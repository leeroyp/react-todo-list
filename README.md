This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Todo List (react practise)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Descriptions `

This project was built for the purposes of learning more about react. In this app, we utilize just every basics aspect of react. In the application you will find a thorough use of Props, Hooks and States. I also used react-router-Dom in oder to run the multiple pages i have in the pages. Finally to add to the back-end, I used axios in order to make Api calls. 



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
